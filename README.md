# LSM9DS0 Library for the PIC32 Microcontroller

This library was developed by Leo Mehr, Alex Spitzer, and Einar Veizaga in their [self-balancing robot project](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2015/aes368_ljm262_eev25/aes368_ljm262_eev25/webpage/index.html).

Inspired by equivalent [library for Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LSM9DS0_Library).
